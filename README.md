# rspec_inheritance
rspec Ruby class inheritance testing

When running `ruby lib/song.rb` you will see all expected output. However, there is this trailing nil at the very end, which causes 3/4 of the rspec test cases to fail. 

Since the inheritance from Song < Album worked, I am uploading it to github and I will work on fixing this over the 11/24 weekend.

Keep rowing.
